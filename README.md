# Installation

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `^`.

```
composer require wyrihaximus/react-psr-7-stream
```

# Usage

This package assumes you run all code using it inside fibers. The following example makes a HTTP request using
[`react/http`](https://reactphp.org/http/#streaming-response), decorates the body, and loops over it until the full
body has been received. Important, while looping, do not use any other [`await`](https://reactphp.org/async/#await)
calls whatsoever inside the loop. Doing so might make you miss a `data` event from the `ReadableStreamInterface`. This
package is build for high performance low memory usage, it will not buffer data for you.

```php
$response = await((new Browser())->requestStreaming('GET', 'https://example.com'));
assert($response instanceof ResponseInterface);
$body = $response->getBody();
assert($body instanceof ReadableStreamInterface);
$stream = new Stream($body);
while (! $stream->eof()) {
    $ticks++;
    $content .= $stream->read(PHP_INT_MAX);
}
```
